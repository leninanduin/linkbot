## What it does?

replaces http://twitter.com/ACTION for tweetbot:///ACTION urls, ONLY FOR MAC.

## Works on:

- @username links & widget
- Tweet official widget (with current paget title & url)
- Embeded twitts
- Tweet to @USERNAME official widget
- Tweet #HASHTAG official widget
- replay to tweet links
- Url to #HASHTAG
- Url to tweet id
- YouTube sharing
- Redability sharing
- Pocket sharing
- addThis widgets (partially)
- po.st widget
- sharethis widget ( not for dinamically generated widgets  )
- Dinamically generated official widgets (loaded after a  callback -page scroll or something-)


## Needs fix

- follow buttons (actually just links to the user profile)
- fav buttons (actually just links to the tweet)
- retweet buttons (actually just links to the tweet)
